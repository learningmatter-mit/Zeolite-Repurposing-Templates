# Code for: "Repurposing Templates for Zeolite Synthesis from Simulations and Data Mining"

This repository has the code and data to reproduce all plots from the following paper:

D. Schwalbe-Koda et al. Repurposing Templates for Zeolite Synthesis from Simulations and Data Mining. Under Review (2022).

The code used to reproduce the plots is available at the [code](code/) folder. The data is available at the Materials Data Facility under the DOI [10.18126/c5z9-zej7](https://doi.org/10.18126/c5z9-zej7), and is loaded automatically wtihin the Jupyter Notebooks. 

The Jupyter notebooks require the following packages to run correctly:
